## Overview

This project is an **Android version** of an advanced scientific calculator originally built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes features such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic calculations, exponentiation, and more. This version extends those functionalities into a native Android app, providing a more seamless and mobile-friendly user experience.

### Features

- **Trigonometric Functions**: Calculate `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, and their inverses.
- **Logarithmic Functions**: `log` and `ln` support.
- **Exponentiation**: Use `^` for raising to a power.
- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Constants**: `Ï€` and `e` included for easier calculations.
- **Factorial Function**: Supports calculation of factorials for positive integers.
- **Advanced Display**: User-friendly interface with a dark theme and auto-scaling display for long expressions.
  
### Tech Stack

- **Java/Kotlin** for Android development
- **XML** for UI design
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Original web version for reference)
